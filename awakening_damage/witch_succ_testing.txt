1135-1277

Absolute: Staff Attack does not get 70/30 split


Fireball IV at 91/91 + 25 (1100%) *should* do 913-1045
But we only see ~765-836. Something is wrong. Even the 70/30 split doesn't account for this.
This damage drop is regardless of Succ/Awk
Fireball IV shows the wrong Skill %

Absolute: Earth's Response is fine (correct Skill %)
