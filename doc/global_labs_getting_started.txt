* Create any character
* Always choose Ancient Stone Chamber main quest
  - Mountain of Eternal Winter can't be completed and locks you out of most other quests
* DO NOT THROW AWAY YOUR STARTING WEAPONS
* Immediately go to Velia, to Alustin
* Each character gets a special challenge reward: max inventory slots, max weight, and 5 mil gold bars
  - Use these gold bars for your initial base silver
* There will be a special Eiorah NPC across from Alustin. She sells Global Labs gear.
* Buy gold bars from Eiorah, then sell them back to her for double
  - You can double your silver each time you sell
* Use Google Translate to figure out what to buy. One of every box is okay to start. There's an augmented reality camera mode.
  - Recommend keeping IV/V of every weapon, armor, and accessory
  - IV Armors and V Body are less important
* There is an Eiorah's Tome to buy. This book gives the same stats as completing all journals
* The first item 'Adventurer's Box' contains a 3 day old moon bundle (VP, etc) and maids/butlers. Buy as many as you like.
* There should be a challenge for all 3 dream horses. You cannot get more than 1 of each.
  - Buy Carrot Confit from Eiorah. They start at level 1 but have all skills mastered.
* There should be a challenge that gives you a pearl tent (there is no pearl shop).
* Buy an Azwell main weapon from Alfredo (next to skill instructor)
  - Enhance it to at least IV, V recommended
  - Global labs lets you buy infinite enhancing mats (Eiorah) and infinite crons (from blacksmiths via infinite money)
  - Azwell is important because no species damage
* You'll need to do your Awakening questline until it lets you equip your Awakening weapon, then you can drop it.
* There is no way to get artifacts or lightstones. If you really want them, Kratuga grinding is the way to go (tag a sage).
* DO NOT ENTER Erethea's Limbo under any circumstances. It is bugged, and you will be permanently stuck.
* There is a one-time family quest for a Blue Awakening Weapon box from Sarma Arin (leader of Sausan outpost). Reward is ~10 quests deep, but it's fast.
