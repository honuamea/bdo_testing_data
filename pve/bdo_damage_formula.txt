=========

* [Complete] Do skill modifiers apply below DR breakpoint?
  - Yes, absolutely

* [Complete] Is BDO Codex DR accurate?
  - Probably (confirmed at Mirumok; 333)
  - Blind test: Manshaum
    + Warrior: 342-350
    + Actual from BDO Codex: 345
  - Blind test: Turos
  - Blind test: Ahibs
  - Blind test: Sherekhan
  - Confirmed, though it can be hard to tell which mob
    + Loot tables are the best confirmation, followed by titles
    + Anything else (even location) is not guaranteed (eg Okjinsini)

* [Complete] Does damage scale from your auto-attack/normal?
  - Confirmed NO. 100% is 100% given same AP.
  - AP: 176 sheet (307 total); V Blackstar, V Debo Neck
  - Striker:
    + Basic Attack (697%): 105-109
    + Adamantine(675%): 206-214; 102-107
    + 'Damage reduced during cooldown' = ~50%
    + Basic attack w/306: 1877-1970
    + Adamantine crit w/306 (680):
      > 3813, 3844, 3813, 3836, 3883, 3720, 3747, 3861, 3770, 3821
      > 3720-3883 (avg 3811)
  - Mystic:
    + Basic Attack (760%): 114-118
    + Adamantine (675%): 205-213; 112-118
    + Basic attack w/306: 2070-2172
    + Adamatine crit w/306 (680): 
      > 3858, 3738, 3780, 3839, 3887, 3776, 3840, 3896, 3765, 3757
      > 3738-3896 (avg 3814)
* [Duplicate] Does skill percent scale off of r10 auto-attack?
  - Hypothesis #1: 100% is 100%, regardless of class
  - Hypothesis #2: Classes have a hidden base damage, but 100% is 100% within the class.

* [Complete] Does species damage apply below DR breakpoint?
  - Hypothesis: No
  - Kind-of:
    + Some species damage applies to DR breakpoint (not 100%)
    + Actual species DAMAGE only applies past breakpoint
  - Future work: what happens if species damage is what pushes
    you over the DR breakpoint?

* [Complete] What scaling is applied to species damage above DR breakpoint?
  - Hypothesis: 0.85
  - Test w/human damage (armor) @Abandoned Monastery
  - Scaling is 14.2 compared to normal 16.6 of AP, or ~0.85

* [Complete] How much AP is added for A vs A+ ranks
  - Hypothesis: +5 (A), +7 (A+) for +12 total
  - Confirmed by Phelsong
  - Needs double confirmation
  - ZERO - Knowledge does not change damage ranges
    + Double-confirmed at both Ronaros (C vs A) & Mirumok (C vs S)

* [Complete] Does Shai apply -10% or -35 DR with Florang?
  - Hypothesis: -35 DR
  - Confirmed (Fadus): -35 DR, not -10%
  - At Calpheon Elvia (Giants), seems to be -45
    + Future work: Needs additional testing

* [Complete] How do AP caps function?
  - Hypothesis: Caps (sheet) AP at the area cap
  - Clear cap confirmed at Fadus
  - Hard caps at specific total AP
  - Monster AP counts are regular AP for caps
  - Species damage applies over cap

* [Reject] Is BDO Codex evasion correct
  - Test Gyfin Rhasia (lower) Flamen (720)
  - BDO Codex is based on a leak from Nov 2021. Any/all data can be outdated.
  - We've also found evidence that Codex DRs are...off.

* [Complete] Does species damage scale w/skill percent?
  - Yes, absolutely

* [Complete] Do awk/succ specs change damage at same AP?
  - Technically no. 100% for same AP is the same regardless
  - But also kind of. A fraction of Awk/Mainhand AP applies to the other spec, boosting AP. This *is not* captured on the stats page.

* [Complete] Confirm skill percent scales properly above DR breakpoint
  - Confirmed w/full curve at Waragons (0 DR)

* [Complete] Test damage at AP-capped spot
  - Confirmed cap at Fadus

* [Complete] Test full AP range at low DR, high HP spot
  - Gatekeepers!
  - Waragons/Basis/Shultz (IF not AP-capped)

* [Complete] Test AP ranges below DR breakpoint
  - Expected: range will widen as AP range widens, despite base damage
  - Below DR breakpoint, only base damage (0.05*AP) applies.
  - AP rolls still happen, but few show more than 1 point of difference due to the 0.05 coefficient.

* [Complete] Confirm AP softcap at Basis (240 DR; estimated 490 softcap)
  - 255 DR; 322 softcap

* [Complete] Test human damage at Sausans

* [Complete] What happens if species damage is what pushes
  you over the DR breakpoint?
  - Does the complete species damage apply, or just leftover?
  - Species applies to AP as rand(0.7, 1.0)*AP. If below DR breakpoint, it applies towards the breakpoint.
  - Only leftover species damage over the DR breakpoint adds to damage.
    + 240 AP + 10 species damage vs 247 DR will apply 0-3 extra points of damage

* [Complete] Confirm that species damage DOES NOT apply twice (eg Kama & all-species)
  - Species damage only applies once

* [Complete] Test Kutum damage damage bug (always min roll) w/Striker & Mystic
  - Confirmed -2 applies on other classes

* [Complete] Test weapon damage ranges
  - Need to control for species damage (Ultimate Green recommended)
  - Identified weapon dies for most weapon AP ranges

* [Complete] Does Mainhand add damage to Shai Talent skills?
  - Yes. Confirmed at Waragons (2400 -> 2900 damage from florang switch)
  - Future work: Could use exact % testing

* [Complete] Does BDO replace the unarmed weapon die or add another?
  - BDO adds another die, based on probability distributions
  - This site is your best friend: http://topps.diku.dk/torbenm/troll.msp

* [Complete] How does DR shred work?
  - It subtracts from enemy DR as expected. This lowers the DR breakpoint, but NOT the softcap. The net effect is X 'true damage', scaling 1:1 over DR breakpoint, where -X DR was the shred.
  - Does it apply over softcap?
    Yes. Softcaps are AP, not EAP. DR shred ignores softcap entirely.

* How does mainhand AP towards Awakening or Awakening AP towards Succ work (for non-Shai)?

* How do Elvia weapons work?
  - What about elemental weakness?

* How do Elvia Orcs lights work?

* How do Gyfin buffs work?

* Damage calculator is off by 1 DR for ultra-low Waragons
  - Estimated at 1 DR otherwise

* How do crits work?
  - Is it just +100% damage (+ modifiers)?
  - Confirm crit rate boost per 'Critical Hit' level

* Do -DP Addons work the same as DR shred?

* Does Shai have an automatic -50% PvP damage modifier (on top of class vs class modifiers) that other classes don't have?

* What does 'max <N> hits' mean in skill descriptions?

* Formula for 1 AP vs 1% Crit Damage vs 1% Crit Chance

* Orcs AP cap is 320? (CM info)

DEBUG
=====

BDO Codex DRs really *are* correct.


Case #1 == Case #2 when? (Assume 0 species to make it easier)
0.05*pve_ap_roll <= pve_ap_roll - enemy_dr
0.05*pve_ap_roll + enemy_dr <= pve_ap_roll
enemy_dr <= 0.95 * pve_ap_roll
pve_ap_roll >= enemy_dr / 0.95 == enemy_dr * 100 / 95

Most efficient check (1 extra multiplication):
if 20 * (pve_ap_roll - enemy_dr + species_ap_roll) >= pve_ap_roll
OR (pve_ap_roll - enemy_dr + species_ap_roll) > pve_ap_roll / 20

Can we design a generic formula?
0.05 * pve_ap_roll + is_breakpoint*(0.95*pve_ap_roll - enemy_dr)

(95 * pve_ap_roll - 100 * enemy_dr) / 100
(5 * pve_ap_roll + 95 * pve_ap_roll - 100 enemy_dr) / 100
(5 * pve_ap_roll + 100 * pve_ap_roll - 100 enemy_dr - 5 * pve_ap_roll) / 100
base_damage = 0.05*pve_ap_roll
above_dr = pve_ap_roll - enemy_dr - base_damage
if above_dr > 0  --> pve_ap_roll - enemy_dr > base_damage
--> pve_ap_roll > base_damage + enemy_dr


# Invalid formula: doesn't hardcap AP if multiplier is 0
damage_ap = \
    0.05*pve_ap_roll + 0.95*undercap_eap + X*overcap_ap + species_ap_roll
    = 0.05*pve_ap_roll + 0.95*(ap_cap - enemy_dr) + X*(pve_ap_roll - ap_cap) +
      species_ap_roll
    = (0.05 + X)*pve_ap_roll + (0.95 - X)*ap_cap - 0.95*enemy_dr +
      species_ap_roll
# where X ~ cap_multiplier
# at hardcap, X=0:
    = 0.05*pve_ap_roll + 0.95*(ap_cap - enemy_dr) + species_ap_roll
# but this is CLEARLY wrong: base damage does not continue to go up past hardcap

Assume a multiplier of 0.5 and (still) a weighted average:
0.05*pve_ap_roll + 0.95*0.5*(pve_ap_roll - ap_cap)
= (0.05 + 0.475)*pve_ap_roll - 0.475*ap_cap
= 0.525 - 0.475*ap_cap


DR Testing State-Machine:

0 - 'Know Nothing'
* Choose an AP and go (first state only)
* If full AP range matches base damage formula -> 'Below DR'
* If low AP matches base damage, but high does not -> 'DR Breakpoint'
* If full AP range > base damage, we don't know if we're in EAP range or Softcap -> 'Above DR'

1 - 'Find DR: Below'
* Choose a higher AP and go (bisect if possible)
* If full AP range matches base damage formula -> Stay 'Below DR'
* If low AP matches base damage, but high does not -> 'DR Breakpoint'
* If full AP range > base damage, we don't know if we're in EAP range or Softcap -> 'Above DR'

2 - 'Find DR: Above' 
* Bisect downwards, as we can't calculate softcap yet.

3 - 'Find DR: Breakpoint'
* Find the exact spot where 1 AP triggers the gap from base -> EAP formula
  - Min roll first crosses over to EAP range
  - Max roll first crosses over to EAP range
* We know the weapon dice, and can use this to find the spot w/min/max rolls
* On finding the exact DR -> 'Find Softcap: Guess'

4 - 'Found DR' / 'Find Softcap: Guess'
* We can now evaluate the EAP formula (Case #2)
* If full AP range matches EAP formula -> 'Find Softcap: Below'
* If full AP range < EAP damage -> 'Find Softcap: Above'
* If low AP matches EAP damage but high does not -> 'Softcap Breakpoint'

5 - 'Find Softcap: Below'
* Bisect upwards

6 - 'Find Softcap: Above'
* Can't calculate above softcap without softcap modifier
* Bisect downwards

7 - 'Find Softcap: Breakpoint'
* We don't narrow in, just find the bounds.
* Proceed -> 'Find Softcap Reduction'

8 - 'Find Softcap Reduction'
* Calculate the softcap reduction using values above max + max dice roll
* Proceed -> 'Pinpoint Softcap'

9 - 'Pinpoint Softcap'
* Iterate through all possible softcaps until the above-softcap damage numbers match




There will be multiple DR values that match all collected data *until* we zoom in on the exact DR
It's also possible that we miss some damage values. Below DR breakpoint, we can figure this out by comparing to the actual damage formula.
  - We should *never* have values outside of the range, or something's wrong with the formula.


Damage increase pre-breakpoint will be 0.05*skill_percent/AP
Damage increase post-breakpoint will be 1.0*skill_percent
Eg, a 0.83 (or nearly 1 damage/AP) increase for Swing Swing will suddenly become >16 damage/AP after breakpoint
So being > expected is not enough. We must be > expected by skill_percent (eg 16)
BUT we still test with 100x1 sometimes. An accumulated increment of 1 here is impossible to tell from 1:1 growth until we see it twice in a row.
- Must see max(2, 95*skill_percent//10000)

The point at which we see a major increase is actually 1 point *over* DR.
